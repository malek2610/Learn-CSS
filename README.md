## CSS Introduction

### What is & Why use CSS?

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media

    body {
    background-color: lightblue;
    }

    h1 {
    color: brown;
    text-align: center;
    }

    p {
    font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;
    font-size: 20px;
    }
    ```
