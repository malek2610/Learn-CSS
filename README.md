# Learn CSS

CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

This course breaks down the fundamentals of CSS into digestible, easy to understand pieces. Over the next few modules, you'll learn how the core aspects of CSS work and how to use them effectively in your projects.

## CSS Introduction

### What is & Why use CSS?

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
- CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

Bellow a very basic `CSS` example:

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: brown;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

## CSS Syntax

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
